This reliance spans critical areas, including energy, agriculture, trade, transportation, foreign direct investment (FDI), and remittances. This report evaluates the risks associated with Armenia’s dependence on a narrow set of external partners and underscores the need for economic diversification. Key highlights are that the majority of Armenia’s natural gas and petroleum imports originate from Russia, while its agricultural trade, machinery imports, and textile exports also exhibit significant concentration. Additionally, Russian entities dominate strategic infrastructure such as telecommunications and rail transport, as well as electricity generation, transmission and distribution. Remittances from Russia have constituted an average of 60% of total remittance inflows in 2013-2022, further exposing Armenia to external economic shocks. Such dependence threatens Armenia’s economic sovereignty, heightening vulnerability to foreign economic leverage and periods of economic instability abroad. To mitigate these risks, the report advocates for diversification of trade partnerships, investments, and domestic production, aiming to bolster resilience, encourage innovation, and foster sustainable economic growth.\n\n\n\nThe Effect of the Demand-Side Management Financial Incentive Program on Energy Savings: Evidence from Minnesota\n\nAbstract:\nIn Minnesota, the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) allocates annual financial incentives to investor-owned electric and gas utilities through the Demand-Side Management (DSM) Financial Incentive Program, rewarding utilities for achieving energy savings thresholds. The program is designed to offset energy companies’ disincentive to save energy due to the resulting loss in energy sales volume and revenues. While utilities consistently advocate for increased financial incentives, critics argue the awards are excessive and call for program scaling. This paper estimates the causal effect of an additional dollar in financial incentives on energy savings (kWh), using lagged average winter temperatures as an instrument. We find that each additional incentive dollar generates a first-year energy savings increase of 5.34 kWh, corresponding to a 53.5-cent first-year return and an average present discounted lifetime return of $6.65 per dollar spent, indicating that investments in the DSM Financial Incentive Program are financially justified. These results imply a present discounted value of $327.05 in lifetime savings for the average residential ratepayer in Minnesota. The study situates these findings within the broader context of net benefits accrued to Minnesota residents from energy efficiency programs administered by the state’s investor-owned electric and gas utilities."

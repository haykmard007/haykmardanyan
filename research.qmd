### The Effect of the Demand-Side Management Financial Incentive Program on Energy Savings: Evidence from Minnesota

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

In Minnesota, the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) allocates annual financial
incentives to investor-owned electric and gas utilities through the Demand-Side
Management (DSM) Financial Incentive Program, rewarding utilities for achieving
energy savings thresholds. The program is designed to offset energy companies’
disincentive to save energy due to the resulting loss in energy sales volume and
revenues.
While utilities consistently advocate for increased financial incentives, critics argue the
awards are excessive and call for program scaling. This paper estimates the causal
effect of an additional dollar in financial incentives on energy savings (kWh), using
lagged average winter temperatures as an instrument.
We find that each additional incentive dollar generates a first-year energy savings
increase of 5.34 kWh, corresponding to a 53.5-cent first-year return and an average
present discounted lifetime return of $6.65 per dollar spent, indicating that investments
in the DSM Financial Incentive Program are financially justified. These results imply a
present discounted value of $327.05 in lifetime savings for the average residential
ratepayer in Minnesota. The study situates these findings within the broader context of
net benefits accrued to Minnesota residents from energy efficiency programs
administered by the state’s investor-owned electric and gas utilities.
